aghast: the human-friendly hash translator
 
USAGE
-----
   Aghast translates unpronounceable hashes into friendly names and vice-versa.
For example, we can invoke aghast with some hashes we got from git:

    $ aghast 9f23a18123901 a2ce23
     Cluttered Essential Stingray
     Colorful Ill Cockroach

   Note that Aghast only bothers with the first seven characters of the hash, thus
these produce the same results:

    $ aghast 9f23a18123901 9f23a1812 9f23a18
     Cluttered Essential Stingray
     Cluttered Essential Stingray
     Cluttered Essential Stingray

   Aghast can also go the other way, translating the human-friendly names back into
hashes:

    $ aghast 'Cluttered Essential Stingray' 'Colorful Ill Cockroach'
     9f23a1
     a2ce23 

   Be sure to surround those names in quotes when on the command line!  Aghast will
also gladly read from STDIN for you if '-' is supplied as an argument:

    $ echo '9f23a1' | ./aghast -
     Cluttered Essential Stingray
     
VERSION 2
---------
   Version 2 of Aghast fixes a bug that could lead to an irreversible name (50/50 chance if the name contained "adorable") and doubles the number of words available for names.  As a result, names generated with version 2 can not be reversed by version 1.  All names generated by version 1 can be reversed using version 2, with the possible exception of names containing "adorable".
   Two options, `--v1` and `--v2` have been added to force the behaviors of the specified version.
